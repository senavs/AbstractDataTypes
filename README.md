## About the project
&nbsp; **Hello World!**. Welcome to my **Abstract Data Types** GitHub Portfolio. This project it's just me **reinventing the wheel**. 
In others words, It's some Abstract Data Types implemented using Python from scratch.
&nbsp; There are documentations, exemplos and the code. You can also download, use or even, improve them.  
&nbsp; That is it! :D

## Projects
- [Queue](https://github.com/senavs/AbstractDataTypes/tree/master/queue) - 
  Abstract Data Type with **F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut rule.
- [Circular Queue](https://github.com/senavs/AbstractDataTypes/tree/master/circular_queue) - 
  A different Queue implementation which uses the modulo operator instead of Cell class.
- [Deque](https://github.com/senavs/AbstractDataTypes/tree/master/deque) - 
  An improvement of Queue Data Type which allows add to and remove from both sides.
- [Dequeued Queue](https://github.com/senavs/AbstractDataTypes/tree/master/dequeued_queue) - 
  A Deque with new feature. It'll remove an element when if full, instead of raise an error.
- [Stack](https://github.com/senavs/AbstractDataTypes/tree/master/stack) - 
  Abstract Data Type with **F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut rule.
- [Linked List](https://github.com/senavs/AbstractDataTypes/tree/master/linked_list) - 
  A list abstract data type which each cell can only access the next cell.
- [Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/senavs/AbstractDataTypes/tree/master/doubly_linked_list) - 
  A list abstract data type which each cell can access the next and the preivious cell. Easy to search, insert and remove elements.
- [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/senavs/AbstractDataTypes/tree/master/binary_search_tree) - 
  Abstract data type based on Nodes which the left nodes have a lower key_id than the parent node and the right nodes have higher key_id.
