# Stack

## What is that?
&nbsp; Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements.
To keep the order as a real stack, **LIFO** (**L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**It) rule is followed. 
This abstract data type is implemented with three methods:
- **PUSH** - Insert elements at the top of the stack.
- **POP** - Remove elements at the top of the stack and return them.  
- **PEEK** - Return the element at the top of the list without *pop* it.
